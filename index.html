            Hi, I am Alexandro Cazares, an aspiring software developer and a professional musician. Also a proud Hoosier of immigrant parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a musician, I teach young musicians to be the best version of themselves on and off the stage. Also, I
            perform on the double bass in the classical and jazz community. But I feel like my musical passion is
            limited to only a certain group.
            <br>
            <br>
            So I asked myself:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p>
                <i>Self</i>, what can I design and build that can reach millions of people <em>and</em> make a
                difference in the world?
            </p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer">Me in 2020 </footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            That is why I switched to the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the years as a professional musician, I realized my skills are transferrable to the tech industry
            through the many conversations with my mentors. I found myself growing a new curiosity after learning about
            Software Developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was not until the Covid-19 lockdown I was forced to restructure my freelancing business. I heard about
            Eleven Fifty Academy’s Software Development Boot Camp program. The rest is history.
        </p>
        <p>
            In three months, I learned how to code and create application, something I had NEVER done in my life before.
            I was used to the rigorous curriculum from my previous two music degrees, but this was different. What I
            learned in 3 months of coding felt like the 7 years of a music education.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 12-week program allowed me to excel through the project-based assignments in groups and solo, as well as
            continuing to refine my desire to be: improving, learning, and executing my transferrable skills:
            communication, detail-oriented problem solving, organization, and creative thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am seeking and looking forward to a long career of growth in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for reading and visiting my portfolio.
